## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Reads analog values from a potentiometer (0-4095, 12-bit ADC)  
- Controls LED brightness smoothly using PWM  
- Displays sensor values on the Serial Monitor

## ðŸ›  Required Hardware
- ESP32 development board  
- Potentiometer  
- LED  
- 220Î© resistor (for LED)  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable (data-capable)

## âš¡ Connections
| Component       | ESP32 Pin |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Potentiometer   | GPIO 32   |
| LED             | GPIO 33   |
| LED Resistor    | Series with LED to GND |

> Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to **GPIO32**, and the other two pins to **3.3V and GND**.  
> Connect the long leg of the LED to **GPIO33** and the short leg to **GND** through a 220Î© resistor.
